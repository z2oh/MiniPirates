# MiniPirates

This is my game for cgc-spring-2016. It is an arcade style pirate themed game where your only goal is to become as rich and powerful as possible. Destroying other ships and sailing over their wrecks will earn you gold that you can use to upgrade your ship back at Pirate Port. Watch out for pirate hunters, they are after the bounty on your head and are quite formidable.

Accelerate with W, decelerate with S, turn left and right with A and D.
Shoot left with Q and shoot right with E.

The game is still in very, very, very early alpha.

The game and engine are written in MonoGame. Currently, no outside libraries or code is being used.
